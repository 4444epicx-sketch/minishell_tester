A robust testing framework for verifying the behavior of minishell implementations.

## Overview

The `minishell_tester` project provides a comprehensive suite of tests to evaluate the correctness and robustness of minishell programs. Minishells are simplified shell implementations often created as educational projects. This tester automates the process of verifying that a minishell behaves as expected according to standard shell specifications. It aims to simplify and standardize the testing process, providing clear and detailed feedback on the minishell's performance.

## Features

-   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Includes tests for basic commands, pipes, redirections, environment variables, and more.
-   **Automated Testing:** Simplifies the testing process with automated execution and result reporting.
-   **Customizable:** Allows users to define their own test cases and configurations.
-   **Detailed Reporting:** Provides detailed information on test results, including error messages and performance metrics.
-   **Easy Integration:** Designed for easy integration into existing development workflows.
-   **Basic Commands:** Tests for `echo`, `pwd`, `cd`, `env`, `export`, `unset`, and `exit`.
-   **Pipes:** Testing command chaining with pipes (`|`).
-   **Redirections:** Testing input and output redirections (`>`, `<`, `>>`).
-   **Environment Variables:** Testing variable expansion and manipulation.
-   **Error Handling:** Testing error conditions and handling (e.g., command not found).
-   **Signal Handling:** Verifies correct signal handling (e.g., Ctrl+C, Ctrl+\\).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A working minishell implementation
-   A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
-   Make

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

bash
    ./tester <path_to_minishell>
    This command runs the tester against the `my_minishell` executable located in the current directory:

makefile
> MINISHELL_PATH = /path/to/your/minishell  # Path to the minishell executable
> TIMEOUT = 5                             # Timeout for each test case (seconds)
> VALGRIND = yes                           # Enable Valgrind memory leak checking (yes/no)
> # Add any other custom flags or configurations here
> Add or modify test cases in the `tests/` directory. Follow the existing test case structure for consistency.  Use descriptive filenames for new test cases (e.g., `test_pipe_multiple.sh`).
